	"Cold One": "<p>Only one Cold One can be summoned per day, and Cold Ones are not tradable, so the calculator limits consumption to one per day. (Theoretically, it could be advantageous to save up items and consume different numbers on different days, but the calculator does not account for this.) A Cold One will grant fewer adventures if your level is lower than 11. The calculator assumes you will get the maximum number of adventures.",
